                <button class="accordion">1) Is there an "official" Mardi Gras? </button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not
                        believe
                        the
                        claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras
                        website.
                        Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those
                        who
                        do
                        not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each
                        individual
                        parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts of the country, official
                        organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.</p>

                <button class="accordion">2) When does Mardi Gras start and end?
                </button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi
                        Gras
                        day
                        (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.<br>

                        Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                        Tuesday
                        is always the day before Ash Wednesday.<br>

                        Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through
                        Ash
                        Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few
                        years.

                <button class="accordion">3) What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I
                    pack?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will
                        change
                        from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since
                        a
                        chilly
                        morning may turn into a warm afternoon.<br>

                        Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get
                        somewhat
                        dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll
                        definitely
                        want
                        to bring a raincoat!</p>

                <button class="accordion">4) How much does it cost to go to Mardi Gras?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. That's why
                        we
                        call

                <button class="accordion">5) I only have limited time. What is the prime time to visit during Mardi
                    Gras?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the
                        weekend
                        when Bacchus and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets of
                        New
                        Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can
                        stay
                        longer
                        than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days to experience Mardi
                        Gras.
                        Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras festival goes
                        on
                        all
                        day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the costumes and masks
                        is a
                        unique and thrilling experience.</p>

                <button class="accordion">6) What are the best ways to get around New Orleans once I've
                    arrived?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>The best methods of transportation will be via taxi/ride-sharing services, streetcar or rental
                        car
                        depending on where you're staying. Driving your own car and finding parking spots will be
                        difficult.

                <button class="accordion">7) Where should I go if someone needs first aid during a parade?</button>
                <div class="panel">

                        aid
                        in some of the most populated areas along the parade routes. They are trained in CPR and first

                        and
                        will assist the ill and injured at each of their stations positioned along the parade
                        routes.<br>

                        First aid stations will be available on the following corners along St. Charles Avenue during

                        of

                        Canal Street, Napoleon Avenue, Washington Avenue, Felicity Street, Lee Circle.<br>
                        Additionally, first aid stations will be available at Orleans Avenue and North Hennessy Street,
