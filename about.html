                <h3>Mardi Gras history</h3>
                <p>
                    The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the
                    17th
                    and
                    18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf
                    Gras,"
                    or
                    fatted calf, followed France to her colonies.<br><br>

                    On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a
                    plot
                    of
                    ground 60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men
                    realized
                    it
                    was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which
                    is
                    now
                    Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very
                    first
                    Mardi Gras.<br><br>

                    In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our
                    current
                    Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded
                    from
                    1711
                    through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men.
                    Later,
                    Rex
                    would parade with an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This
                    occurred
                    on Fat Tuesday.<br><br>

                    New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in
                    New
                    Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the
                    Marquis
                    de
                    Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras
                    balls of
                    today.<br><br>

                    The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial
                    governing
                    body. That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of
                    clubs
                    and
                    carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.<br><br>

                    By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback
                    riders to
                    celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members
                    and
                    lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed
                    the
                    Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus
                    brought
                    magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls.
                    Krewe
                    members remained anonymous.<br><br>

                    In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also the first
                    recorded
                    account of Mardi Gras "throws."<br><br>

                    Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed "Carnival Edition"
                    lithographs of parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats
                    were
                    always carefully guarded before the procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and
                    details
                    could
                    not be clearly seen. But beginning in 1886 with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these
                    chromolithographs could be produced in full, saturated color, doing justice to the float and costume
                    designs
                    of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these designers' work was brought
                    to
                    life
                    by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who for 40 years was responsible for
                    creating
                    all
                    of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.<br><br>

                    1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside over the
                    first
                    daytime parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen introduced
                    Romanoff's family colors of purple, green and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for
                    justice;
                    gold for power; and green for faith. This was also the Mardi Gras season that Carnival's improbable
                    anthem,
                    "If Ever I Cease to Love," was cemented, due in part to the Duke's fondness for the tune.<br><br>

                    The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans instead of France,
                    culminating
                    with Comus' magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic
                    paper-mache'
                    animal costumes served as the basis for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and local officials,
                    including
                    Governor Henry Warmoth. In 1875, Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a
                    legal
                    holiday in Louisiana, which it still is.<br><br>

                    Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from private
                    social
                    clubs
                    with restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are completely funded
                    by
                    their
                    members, New Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"<br>

                <h3>Mardi Gras traditions</h3>
                <p>
                    Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement. It's one big holiday in New
                    Orleans!<br><br>

                    Revelers know to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn themselves
                    with
                    long
                    beads caught from the floats of previous parades. You'll see a lot of crazy costumes, kids with
                    their
                    families are everywhere, and both locals and visitors having a great time. Parade goers will sit on
                    the
                    ground, throw balls, play music, eat great food and watch the crowds walk by between parades. On
                    Mardi
                    Gras
                    day, the majority of non-essential businesses are shut down because of the celebration.<br><br>

                    Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag with them so they can haul away all the beads and
                    trinkets
                    they will catch from the parades!<br>

                <h3>Mardi Gras colors</h3>
                <p>The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are purple, green, and gold. The
                    colors
                    were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural
                    parade
                    in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these
                    specific
                    colors were chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially selected solely on their
                    aesthetic
                    appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism.<br><br>

                    Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a theory
                    that
                    the
                    colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's goal
                    may
                    have
                    been to create a tricolor to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty,
                    while
                    white was already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted
                    that
                    a
                    flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies with the rule of tincture, which states that
                    metals
                    (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and that colors cannot be placed on
                    or
                    next
                    to other colors.<br><br>

                    Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats
                    themed
                    around the concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that order
                    symbolized justice, power, and faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple,
                    green,
                    and
                    gold, in that order—even though this order technically violates the rule of tincture<br>

                    <div class="mayorText">
                        <p>LaToya Cantrell is an American politician serving as the 62nd Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana
                            since
                            May 7,
                            2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before becoming mayor,
                            Cantrell
                            represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.<br>Cantrell was born
                            as
                            LaToya Wilder
                            in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier
                            University of Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology.She attended an executive
                            training
                            program at
                            the Harvard Kennedy School.</p>
                        <p>Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the
                            city's
                            history.
                            Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of
                            creating a
                            strategic
                            plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence
                            Reduction
                            Council,
                            tasked with finding solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel

                            collected
                            within the city for city use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve
                            city
                            infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and green spaces. As part of that
                            initiative,
                            in
                            October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid manufacturers and
                            distributors.<br>

                            During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share
                            Agreement
                            with
                            Governor John Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50
